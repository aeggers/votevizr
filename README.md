# Diagrams for ordinal voting systems

This project allows users to make diagrams representing election results in various ordinal voting systems: 

- any positional method (three candidate elections only)
   + plurality
   + Borda count
   + anti-plurality
- Condorcet methods, including various ways of resolving cycles
- ranked-choice voting (aka alternative vote, single-winner STV, preferential voting)
